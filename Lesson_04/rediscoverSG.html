                        Jewel Changi Airport (also known as Jewel or Jewel Changi) 
                        is a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex surrounded 
                        by and linked to one of the passenger terminals of Changi Airport, 
                        Singapore. Its centrepiece is the world's tallest indoor waterfall, 
                        the Rain Vortex, that is surrounded by a terraced forest setting.
                        Jewel includes gardens, attractions, a hotel, about 300 retail and 
                        dining outlets, as well as early baggage check-in aviation facilities. 
                        It covers a total gross floor area of 135,700 m2 (1,461,000 sq ft), 
                        spanning 10 storeys - five above-ground and five basement levels. 
                        Its attractions include the Shiseido Forest Valley, an indoor garden 
                        spanning five storeys, and the Canopy Park at the topmost level, featuring 
                        gardens and leisure facilities.

                    <p class="text-control">
                        Located in the historic district of Chinatown, 
                        the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum's richly 
                        designed interiors and comprehensive exhibits on 
                        Buddhist art and history tell stories of culture 
                        over thousands of years old. Built in 2007, the 
                        temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard 
                        as the left canine tooth of Buddha, which has been 
                        recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India 
                        and displayed on the temple's grounds.
